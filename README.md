<h1> Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aakash </h1>

<p>
  I'm humbled that you stumbled here of all the billion other places on the internet. This place is a visual story of my perseverance and development as a software developer. All the bad code I've written, all the trials and tribulations I go through during the process of development are all documented here.

<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
<p>I am an entry-level web developer and a student of Artificial Intelligence seeking entry-level software engineering positions. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago. When I am not programming, I enjoy listening to hip-hop, playing the guitar, working out and watching combat sports.</p>
